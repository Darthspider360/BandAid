## Basics
When creating the basic information for the site, I struggled a little with coming up with the name for the site and the user stories on my own. Because of this, I used Copilot to support me.

### Naming
First I provided Copilot with a generic prompt just to see what it came up with as I was only looking for insparation.

None of the suggested names inspired me and so I tried a slightly more in-depth prompt.

When I saw "Sereneaid" it inspired me to use BandAid due to the connotations of healing and support.
### User Stories 
Once again, I used Copilot to help be out with these too.
To begin with, I noted down my own idea of user needs:

And my own idea of User stories:

I knew these weren't the best and so I turned to Copilot to see what else it could come up with. These are the User needs:

And here are the user stories:

I then selected the ones I thought applied the best to the project and added these to my project board in github.

## User Design
Because I have a background in graphic design I decided to do as much of the design myself, choosing colour and typography using validators and checekrs to make sure they were acceptable and accessible as one of the user stories/needs of my site is to be as accessible as possible.

### Wireframes
I started by drawing out my wireframes by hand. I wanted to keep the design simple so that the site was easily accessible in a crisis.

#### Phone 
Because I was going to create this as mobile first, I made the mobile wireframe first:
