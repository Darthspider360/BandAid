## Basics
When creating the basic information for the site, I struggled a little with coming up with the name for the site and the user stories on my own. Because of this, I used Copilot to support me.

### Naming
First I provided Copilot with a generic prompt just to see what it came up with as I was only looking for insparation.

None of the suggested names inspired me and so I tried a slightly more in-depth prompt.

When I saw "Sereneaid" it inspired me to use BandAid due to the connotations of healing and support.
### User Stories 
Once again, I used Copilot to help be out with these too.
To begin with, I noted down my own idea of user needs:

And my own idea of User stories:

I knew these weren't the best and so I turned to Copilot to see what else it could come up with. These are the User needs:

And here are the user stories:

I then selected the ones I thought applied the best to the project and added these to my project board in github.

## User Design
Because I have a background in graphic design I decided to do as much of the design myself, choosing colour and typography using validators and checekrs to make sure they were acceptable and accessible as one of the user stories/needs of my site is to be as accessible as possible.

### Wireframes
I started by drawing out my wireframes by hand. I wanted to keep the design simple so that the site was easily accessible in a crisis.

#### Phone 
Because I was going to create this as mobile first, I made the mobile wireframe first:

#### Tablet

#### Laptop & PC

### Colour Scheme
Because of the theme of the site I wanted to keep the site colours very soft but also contrasting and so I had a play around on Coolors. Once a randomsize pallet came up, I slight adjusted colours so they weren't too strong on the eye and ended up with this colour pallet:
![An image of a colour pallet from Coolers](assets/images/readme-photos/colors.png)
Now I liked, I went to check their contrasts for accessiblitiy:

One of the user stories mentioned possibly having a light mode and a dark mdoe so I made sure to test it both ways so the same pallet could be used for both. While the other colours didn't have great contrast score, these 2 were the main colours I needed for the site and the others would only be for effects.

### Typography 
Using google fonts, I aimed to find a font I believed was looked tranquil. I liked the idea of a font that looked handwritten as this would make the site feel more personal to its users. As the primary (heading) font I landed on this:

Because the primary font was quiet fancy, I wanted to contrast this with a straight easily readable font for the information since the site is designed to be a source for info links. Exentually I decided on this as the seconday (content) font:
![An image of the google font Manjari](assets/images/readme-photos/secondary-font.png)

### Images

For the images on the site I used a mix of Copilot generated and images from google (for more precice imaging).

Both the hero images and the image in the "tips" section are generated by Copilot. Here are the prompts:
![An image of the index hero image promt](assets/images/readme-photos/index-hero-prompt.png)
![An image of the tips section image promt](assets/images/readme-photos/tips-image-prompt.png)
![An image of the services hero image promt](assets/images/readme-photos/service-hero-prompt.png)

For the cards in the services section, I got one image from istock (the paper chain), 2 images from Canva (check box & art supplies) and the last photo of the puppy is my own (my goodest boy)
