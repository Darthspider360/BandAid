## Basics
When creating the basic information for the site, I struggled a little with coming up with the name for the site and the user stories on my own. Because of this, I used Copilot to support me.

### Naming
First I provided copilot with a generic prompt just to see what it came up with as I was only looking for insparation.

None of the suggested names inspired me and so I tried a slightly more indepth prompt.

When I saw "Sereneaid" it inspired me to use BandAid due to the connotations of healing and support.
